Updates to Chinook data.  

All recoveries were downloaded piecemeal by Eric Ward from the RMIS database for Chinook (species=1) with one recovery file for each year. THIS WAS DONE IN SEPTEMBER 2018.

On 6/5/2019 Ole discovered some recovery location codes that were no longer found in the RMIS data... for the years 2011-2017.  All were in Canada and were for the rec fishery (fishery=40) or the gillnet fisheries (fishery=40).  Ole decided to re download the data for these years and see if that resolved the problem.
