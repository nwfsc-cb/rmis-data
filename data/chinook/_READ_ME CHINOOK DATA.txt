Updates to Chinook data.  

All recoveries were downloaded piecemeal by Eric Ward from the RMIS database for Chinook (species=1) with one recovery file for each year. THIS WAS DONE IN SEPTEMBER 2018.

On 6/5/2019 Ole discovered some recovery location codes that were no longer found in the RMIS data... for the years 2011-2017.  All were in Canada and were for the rec fishery (fishery=40) or the gillnet fisheries (fishery=40).  Ole decided to re download the data for these years and see if that resolved the problem.

On 11/24/2021 Ole re-downloaded 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 data from RMIS and replaced the data for those years to reflect database updates.
